      <p class="change">
        In Chinese mythology, Chang E is the woman in the moon. She was the wife
        of a heroic archer who was rewarded for his services to the gods by a
        gift of the elixir of immortality. In her husband’s absence, she stole
        the potion and drank it herself. She then ascended to the moon and
        became a goddess, though some versions of the tale state that she was
        turned into a three-legged frog as punishment. Yoshitoshi captures Chang
        E in her ascent, rising above the yellow and grey of the clouds to the
        blushing moon. As the ribbons of her robes curl in the wind, she glances
        down at the small frog atop the empty jade container.
